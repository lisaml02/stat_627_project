# Stat 427/627: Statistical Machine Learning
## Course Projects - Summer 2024

**Due Date**: Pending. No later than Friday, June 28, 2024

### Group Work
You will work in groups of **2 â€“ 4** on a course project. 

### Project Objectives
- Apply sound statistical machine learning techniques to a real-world data set.
- Tune the model for better accuracy.
- Assess the model(s) for performance.
- Summarize your findings and make recommendations.
- Provide reproducible code to support your conclusion.

### Data Source
Choose a real-world data set from the following or other approved sources (do not use Kaggle):
- UCI Machine Learning Repository: UCI ML Repository
- Government data: Data.gov (search phrase example: "racial profiling")
- US Bureau of Justice Statistics: BJS

#### Data Set Criteria
- Minimum sample size of 500 (after cleaning missing values)
- At least 8 variables of interest
- Caution with time series data
- No identifiable personal information, classified or proprietary data

### Data Preparation and Exploration
- Clean the data by removing all missing values.
- Randomly split the data, reserving 20% as hold-out testing data.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### Model Fitting and Tuning
- Use at least **FOUR** different statistical learning algorithms.
- Apply cross-validation techniques for tuning.
- Illustrate results with tables, plots, and diagrams.
- Evaluate and comment on the performance of methods.

### Testing on Hold-Out Data
- Ensure models have not been exposed to the hold-out testing data.
- Apply models to the hold-out testing data and evaluate prediction accuracy.

### Presentation
Prepare a **10-15 minute presentation** covering:
1. Background of the data set.
2. EDA findings.
3. Machine learning algorithm implementation:
   - Model fitting.
   - Model tuning.
   - Performance assessment.
4. Summary of findings and recommendations.
5. Testing on hold-out data and explanations for any discrepancies.

### Teamwork
- Divide the workload equitably.
- Each member should be familiar with all aspects of the project.

### Expected Progress
- Form groups and discuss data: **Friday, May 31**
- EDA and variable selection: **Friday, June 7**
- Project outline and model fitting start: **Friday, June 14**
- Continue model fitting, draft slides: **Friday, June 21**
- Presentation: **Tuesday or Thursday, June 25, 27**

### Deliverables
a. Original data set analyzed.
b. R code (script or markdown) with comments for readability.
c. Presentation slides or alternative format.
